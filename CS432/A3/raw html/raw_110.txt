Reporting in Japan, Macotakara believes that <a href='http://www.forbes.com/profile/tim-cook/'>Tim Cook</a> and his team will be holding an event in early March that will see the launch of a Product Red iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, new Apple Watch accessories, an upgraded iPad Pro and <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2017/02/21/new-iphone-se-128gb-release-date/\">a welcome addition of a 128GB model to the iPhone SE portfolio</a>:\r\n</p><blockquote>Given Apple&rsquo;s push to get the SE into markets such as China and India where always-on connectivity to the cloud cannot be guaranteed (either through Wi-Fi or cellular data) having more storage on the lead device in the territory makes sense. Both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus currently offer a 128GB storage option, so bringing the SE up to speed while not updating the rest of the hardware is cost-effective for Apple and a boon to consumers.</blockquote>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2017/02/21/new-iphone-se-128gb-release-date/\">More on the potential of a new iPhone SE here on Forbes</a>.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_23916\" align=\"\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-23916\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/ewanspence/files/2016/04/review_iphoneSE_07.jpg?width=960\" alt=\"Apple iPhone SE (image: Ewan Spence)\" data-height=\"575\" data-width=\"1024\"> Apple iPhone SE (image: Ewan Spence)[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>More Room When You Start Out</strong>\r\n\r\nApple could also be bumping up the storage on 2017&rsquo;s flagship handset. Reporting on the supply chain, TrendForce believes that the new iPhone 8 will not only bump up the entry-level, but reduce the options to two. <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/amitchowdhry/2017/02/21/iphone-8-features-storage/\">Forbes contributor Amit Chowdhry reports</a>:\r\n<blockquote>In regards to storage capacity, TrendForce&rsquo;s supply chain sources claim that the iPhone 8 will have two options: 64GB and 256GB. What is notable about this rumor is that the starting storage option would be 64GB instead of 32GB. However, it seems unusual that Apple would only offer two storage options. Generally, Apple has been selling each of its phones in three storage tiers, including the iPhone 7 -- which has 32GB, 128GB and 256GB options.</blockquote>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/amitchowdhry/2017/02/21/iphone-8-features-storage/\">More analysis here on Forbes</a>.\r\n\r\n<strong>No More Fingerprints On The iPhone 8?</strong>\r\n\r\nThen there&rsquo;s the question of identifying a user. The last few years has seen Apple use TouchID for fingerprint verification. With the presumed removal of the physical home key on the iPhone 8, the expectation has been that Tim Cook&rsquo;s wonder-phone would read your fingerprint through the glass of the screen. JP Morgan&rsquo;s Rod Hall suggests that Apple will drop TouchID in favour of facial recognition. <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2017/02/19/iphone-8-touchid-facial-recognition-iris-scanner/\">Forbes&rsquo; contributor Gordon Kelly highlights the problems</a>:\r\n<blockquote>The flip side is that facial recognition requires a more deliberate unlocking procedure of holding the phone up to your face which can be inconvenient (especially when walking) and may make users more self-conscious than fingerprint unlocking. Facial recognition can also be less reliable for users who wear glasses, contact lenses or sunglasses though this is something the iris scanner in Samsung&rsquo;s ill-fated Galaxy Note 7 aced.</blockquote>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2017/02/19/iphone-8-touchid-facial-recognition-iris-scanner/\">More thoughts on the issues here</a>.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_634120922\" align=\"\" width=\"960\"]<img class=\"dam-image getty size-large wp-image-634120922\" src=\"https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/634120922/960x0.jpg?fit=scale\" data-height=\"630\" data-width=\"960\"> Apple CEO Tim Cook looks at a table during a visit of the shopfitting company Dula that delivers tables for Apple stores (Photo: Bernd Thissen/AFP/Getty Images)[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>But The iPhone Will Be Boring Anyway</strong>\r\n\r\nFor all the interest and excitement over the new iPhone, it&rsquo;s worth remembering that any new technology introduced into Apple&rsquo;s smartphone is likely to have been seen before in competitors&rsquo; handsets. It might be repackaged as new to the iPhone, but the advances in the iPhone 8 aren&rsquo;t always surprises. Which I suspect is by design, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2017/02/23/apple-iphone-8-leak-rumor-new-technology/\">Apple can&rsquo;t risk pushing too hard and having an iPhone fail</a>:\r\n<blockquote>The argument put forward is that Apple is rarely (if ever) first with new technology, but takes the time to perfect the technological advances and have them available in an accessible way. That&rsquo;s a great press spin, but I feel the issue is more about minimizing risk rather than chasing critical acclaim.\r\n\r\nApple&rsquo;s biggest issue is that with a very small portfolio of devices and a significant portion of company revenue coming from the sale of its smartphones it cannot afford to take risks in the way that other manufacturers can. Samsung&rsquo;s Note 7 is a good example of the danger -- the South Korean company had a wide range of products to fall back on when the Note 7 recall saddled the company with a significant charge and no phablet revenue to cover it during Q4 2016. If a similar fate were to happen to an iPhone then Apple has very little depth on the bench to cover any loss of business.</blockquote>\r\nThe secret to Apple&rsquo;s success? <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2017/02/23/apple-iphone-8-leak-rumor-new-technology/\">Being boring</a>.\r\n\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\n\r\n<strong>The Slow Success Of Apple Pay</strong>\r\n\r\nLaunched in October 2014, Apple Pay has slowly become more important to Apple, iPhone users, and the mobile payments industry. Now accepted by over 36% of retailers in the US, the slow growth is continuing to bear fruit.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-pay-already-accepted-third-031206136.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sangara Narayanan looks at the story so far</a>:\r\n<blockquote>Although Apple has been slow to enter into the ecosystem race, the current success they're seeing with Apple Pay will incentivize the company to get a lot more aggressive on that front. With only 13 countries added to the list and still lot of room to cover in the U.S., things are definitely looking up for Apple Pay.\r\n\r\nAs Apple's services segment slowly gains momentum, it will play a huge role in balancing the iPhone-dependent revenue model that Apple currently has. Services revenues during the first quarter of 2017 were $7.2 billion, which pales in comparison to the $54.37 billion dollars Apple made from iPhone sales. But let's not forget that services grew 18% during the quarter compared to last year, while iPhone sales growth is not nearly as high or as sustainable.</blockquote>\r\n<a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-pay-already-accepted-third-031206136.html\" target=\"_blank\">Yahoo Finance has more</a>.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_618582556\" align=\"\" width=\"960\"]<img class=\"dam-image getty size-large wp-image-618582556\" src=\"https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/618582556/960x0.jpg?fit=scale\" data-height=\"640\" data-width=\"960\"> Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks on stage during an Apple product launch event (Photo by Stephen Lam/Getty Images)[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>The Lightest Of Opening Mechanisms</strong>\r\n\r\nOne curious new patent in Apple&rsquo;s portfolio relates to a &lsquo;variable resistance electronic device brake clutch&rsquo;. In short this is a motorised hinge that could be triggered by the lightest of touches on the casing. No more effort or double-handed holds to open up your MacBook, it would be the matter of waving your hand and brushing the lid to have it open automatically. Chris Burns imagines an Apple launch event with this &lsquo;<a href=\"https://www.slashgear.com/how-a-new-macbook-could-reinvent-the-laptop-20475521/\" target=\"_blank\">magic hinge</a>&rsquo;:\r\n<blockquote>This presentation is meant to give users an idea of what it might be like to see Apple introduce the product shown in Apple&rsquo;s own patent for a &ldquo;Variable resistance electronic device brake clutch&rdquo; &ndash; which allows a notebook the ability to move freely instead of relying on frictional resistance to stay in place.\r\n\r\nWhat Apple&rsquo;s invention hopes to accomplish is allowing the user to adjust the display at any time &ndash; even if they have only one hand available. They&rsquo;ll do this, according to this patent, by creating an improved clutch design with a touch activated clutch assembly.</blockquote>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.slashgear.com/how-a-new-macbook-could-reinvent-the-laptop-20475521/\" target=\"_blank\">More dreams of motorised MacBooks at SlashGear</a>.\r\n\r\n<strong>How To Redesign An App</strong>\r\n\r\nMarco Arment&rsquo;s podcast client for iOS is in my opinion a superior application to Apple&rsquo;s own &lsquo;Podcasts&rsquo; app. One of the reasons for Overcast&rsquo;s success is the continued updates Arment codes to keep the client up to date. Version three has just been released, and it&rsquo;s a tour de force of &lsquo;lots of tiny things updated that add up&rsquo;, and <a href=\"https://marco.org/2017/02/20/overcast3\" target=\"_blank\">he has talked about the redesign of an older app on his site</a>.\r\n<blockquote>I designed Overcast 1.0 in 2014 for iOS 7, and it was a product of its time: it used ultra-thin text and lines against stark, sharp-edged, full-screen white sheets and translucent blur panes, with much of the basic functionality behind hidden gestures.

href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2017/02/24/android-google-news-smasung-galaxy-s8-plus-launch-leak-rumor-nokia-mwc/\">and you can read our weekly digest of Android news here on Forbes</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>Here Comes A New iPhone SE</strong></p>\n<p>Apple looks set to surprise the smartphone market with two updates to the iPhone portfolio. Reporting in Japan, Macotakara believes that <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/tim-cook/\" target=\"_self\">Tim Cook</a> and his team will be holding an event in early March that will see the launch of a Product Red iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, new Apple Watch accessories, an upgraded iPad Pro and <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2017/02/21/new-iphone-se-128gb-release-date/\" target=\"_self\">a welcome addition of a 128GB model to the iPhone SE portfolio</a>:</p>\n<blockquote> \n <p>Given Apple’s push to get the SE into markets such as China and India where always-on connectivity to the cloud cannot be guaranteed (either through Wi-Fi or cellular data) having more storage on the lead device in the territory makes sense. Both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus currently offer a 128GB storage option, so bringing the SE up to speed while not updating the rest of the hardware is cost-effective for Apple and a boon to consumers.</p> \n</blockquote>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2017/02/21/new-iphone-se-128gb-release-date/\" target=\"_self\">More on the potential of a new iPhone SE here on Forbes</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_23916\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"> \n <img class=\"size-full wp-image-23916\" src=\"//blogs-images.forbes.com/ewanspence/files/2016/04/review_iphoneSE_07.jpg?width=960\" alt=\"Apple iPhone SE (image: Ewan Spence)\" data-height=\"575\" data-width=\"1024\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Apple iPhone SE (image: Ewan Spence)</p> \n</div>\n<p><strong>More Room When You Start Out</strong></p>\n<p>Apple could also be bumping up the storage on 2017’s flagship handset. Reporting on the supply chain, TrendForce believes that the new iPhone 8 will not only bump up the entry-level, but reduce the options to two. <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/amitchowdhry/2017/02/21/iphone-8-features-storage/\" target=\"_self\">Forbes contributor Amit Chowdhry reports</a>:</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<blockquote> \n <p>In regards to storage capacity, TrendForce’s supply chain sources claim that the iPhone 8 will have two options: 64GB and 256GB. What is notable about this rumor is that the starting storage option would be 64GB instead of 32GB. However, it seems unusual that Apple would only offer two storage options. Generally, Apple has been selling each of its phones in three storage tiers, including the iPhone 7 -- which has 32GB, 128GB and 256GB options.</p> \n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/amitchowdhry/2017/02/21/iphone-8-features-storage/\" target=\"_self\">More analysis here on Forbes</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>No More Fingerprints On The iPhone 8?</strong></p>\n<p>Then there’s the question of identifying a user. The last few years has seen Apple use TouchID for fingerprint verification. With the presumed removal of the physical home key on the iPhone 8, the expectation has been that Tim Cook’s wonder-phone would read your fingerprint through the glass of the screen. JP Morgan’s Rod Hall suggests that Apple will drop TouchID in favour of facial recognition. <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2017/02/19/iphone-8-touchid-facial-recognition-iris-scanner/\" target=\"_self\">Forbes’ contributor Gordon Kelly highlights the problems</a>:</p>\n<blockquote> \n <p>The flip side is that facial recognition requires a more deliberate unlocking procedure of holding the phone up to your face which can be inconvenient (especially when walking) and may make users more self-conscious than fingerprint unlocking. Facial recognition can also be less reliable for users who wear glasses, contact lenses or sunglasses though this is something the iris scanner in Samsung’s ill-fated Galaxy Note 7 aced.</p> \n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2017/02/19/iphone-8-touchid-facial-recognition-iris-scanner/\" target=\"_self\">More thoughts on the issues here</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_634120922\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"> \n <img class=\"dam-image getty size-large wp-image-634120922\" src=\"https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/634120922/960x0.jpg?fit=scale\" data-height=\"630\" data-width=\"960\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Apple CEO Tim Cook looks at a table during a visit of the shopfitting company Dula that delivers tables for Apple stores (Photo: Bernd Thissen/AFP/Getty Images)</p> \n</div>\n<p><strong>But The iPhone Will Be Boring Anyway</strong></p>\n<p>For all the interest and excitement over the new iPhone, it’s worth remembering that any new technology introduced into Apple’s smartphone is likely to have been seen before in competitors’ handsets. It might be repackaged as new to the iPhone, but the advances in the iPhone 8 aren’t always surprises. Which I suspect is by design, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2017/02/23/apple-iphone-8-leak-rumor-new-technology/\" target=\"_self\">Apple can’t risk pushing too hard and having an iPhone fail</a>:</p>\n<blockquote> \n <p>The argument put forward is that Apple is rarely (if ever) first with new technology, but takes the time to perfect the technological advances and have them available in an accessible way. That’s a great press spin, but I feel the issue is more about minimizing risk rather than chasing critical acclaim.</p> \n <p>Apple’s biggest issue is that with a very small portfolio of devices and a significant portion of company revenue coming from the sale of its smartphones it cannot afford to take risks in the way that other manufacturers can. Samsung’s Note 7 is a good example of the danger -- the South Korean company had a wide range of products to fall back on when the Note 7 recall saddled the company with a significant charge and no phablet revenue to cover it during Q4 2016. If a similar fate were to happen to an iPhone then Apple has very little depth on the bench to cover any loss of business.</p> \n</blockquote>\n<p>The secret to Apple’s success? <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2017/02/23/apple-iphone-8-leak-rumor-new-technology/\" target=\"_self\">Being boring</a>.</p>","<p><strong>The Slow Success Of Apple Pay</strong></p>\n<p>Launched in October 2014, Apple Pay has slowly become more important to Apple, iPhone users, and the mobile payments industry. Now accepted by over 36% of retailers in the US, the slow growth is continuing to bear fruit.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-pay-already-accepted-third-031206136.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sangara Narayanan looks at the story so far</a>:</p>\n<blockquote> \n <p>Although Apple has been slow to enter into the ecosystem race, the current success they're seeing with Apple Pay will incentivize the company to get a lot more aggressive on that front. With only 13 countries added to the list and still lot of room to cover in the U.S., things are definitely looking up for Apple Pay.</p> \n <p>As Apple's services segment slowly gains momentum, it will play a huge role in balancing the iPhone-dependent revenue model that Apple currently has. Services revenues during the first quarter of 2017 were $7.2 billion, which pales in comparison to the $54.37 billion dollars Apple made from iPhone sales. But let's not forget that services grew 18% during the quarter compared to last year, while iPhone sales growth is not nearly as high or as sustainable.</p> \n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-pay-already-accepted-third-031206136.html\" target=\"_blank\">Yahoo Finance has more</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_618582556\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"> \n <img class=\"dam-image getty size-large wp-image-618582556\" src=\"https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/618582556/960x0.jpg?fit=scale\" data-height=\"640\" data-width=\"960\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks on stage during an Apple product launch event (Photo by Stephen Lam/Getty Images)</p> \n</div>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p><strong>The Lightest Of Opening Mechanisms</strong></p>\n<p>One curious new patent in Apple’s portfolio relates to a ‘variable resistance electronic device brake clutch’. In short this is a motorised hinge that could be triggered by the lightest of touches on the casing. No more effort or double-handed holds to open up your MacBook, it would be the matter of waving your hand and brushing the lid to have it open automatically. Chris Burns imagines an Apple launch event with this ‘<a href=\"https://www.slashgear.com/how-a-new-macbook-could-reinvent-the-laptop-20475521/\" target=\"_blank\">magic hinge</a>’:</p>\n<blockquote> \n <p>This presentation is meant to give users an idea of what it might be like to see Apple introduce the product shown in Apple’s own patent for a “Variable resistance electronic device brake clutch” – which allows a notebook the ability to move freely instead of relying on frictional resistance to stay in place.</p> \n <p>What Apple’s invention hopes to accomplish is allowing the user to adjust the display at any time – even if they have only one hand available. They’ll do this, according to this patent, by creating an improved clutch design with a touch activated clutch assembly.</p> \n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashgear.com/how-a-new-macbook-could-reinvent-the-laptop-20475521/\" target=\"_blank\">More dreams of motorised MacBooks at SlashGear</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>How To Redesign An App</strong></p>\n<p>Marco Arment’s podcast client for iOS is in my opinion a superior application to Apple’s own ‘Podcasts’ app. One of the reasons for Overcast’s success is the continued updates Arment codes to keep the client up to date. Version three has just been released, and it’s a tour de force of ‘lots of tiny things updated that add up’, and <a href=\"https://marco.org/2017/02/20/overcast3\" target=\"_blank\">he has talked about the redesign of an older app on his site</a>.</p>\n<blockquote> \n <p>I designed Overcast 1.0 in 2014 for iOS 7, and it was a product of its time: it used ultra-thin text and lines against stark, sharp-edged, full-screen white sheets and translucent blur panes, with much of the basic functionality behind hidden gestures. That fundamental design carried through every update until today.</p> \n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://marco.org/2017/02/20/overcast3\" target=\"_blank\">It’s vital reading for any developer</a>, not just those who like podcasts!</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_180239334\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"> \n <img class=\"dam-image getty size-large wp-image-180239334\" src=\"https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/180239334/960x0.jpg?fit=scale\" data-height=\"632\" data-width=\"960\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller speaks during an Apple product announcement (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)</p> \n</div>\n<p><strong>And Finally</strong><strong>…</strong></p>\n<p>It’s always fun when John Gruber fires off a Fisking broadside at the Apple-reporting community (remind me of this when it's my turn in the future). <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/2017/02/investment_jokers\" target=\"_blank\">This time it’s on Apple’s lack of acquisitions and why Bloomberg reported this as a bad thing</a>:</p>\n<blockquote> \n <p>The entire story consists of quotes from investment bankers arguing that Apple should hire investment bankers to make more large acquisitions.

<p>Apple Loop is here to remind you of a few of the very many discussions that have happened around Apple over the last seven days (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2017/02/24/android-google-news-smasung-galaxy-s8-plus-launch-leak-rumor-nokia-mwc/">and you can read our weekly digest of Android news here on Forbes</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Here Comes A New iPhone SE</strong></p>
<p>Apple looks set to surprise the smartphone market with two updates to the iPhone portfolio. Reporting in Japan, Macotakara believes that <a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/tim-cook/" target="_self">Tim Cook</a> and his team will be holding an event in early March that will see the launch of a Product Red iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, new Apple Watch accessories, an upgraded iPad Pro and <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2017/02/21/new-iphone-se-128gb-release-date/" target="_self">a welcome addition of a 128GB model to the iPhone SE portfolio</a>:</p>
<blockquote> 
 <p>Given Apple’s push to get the SE into markets such as China and India where always-on connectivity to the cloud cannot be guaranteed (either through Wi-Fi or cellular data) having more storage on the lead device in the territory makes sense. Both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus currently offer a 128GB storage option, so bringing the SE up to speed while not updating the rest of the hardware is cost-effective for Apple and a boon to consumers.</p>

<p><strong>More Room When You Start Out</strong></p>
<p>Apple could also be bumping up the storage on 2017’s flagship handset. Reporting on the supply chain, TrendForce believes that the new iPhone 8 will not only bump up the entry-level, but reduce the options to two. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/amitchowdhry/2017/02/21/iphone-8-features-storage/" target="_self">Forbes contributor Amit Chowdhry reports</a>:</p>
<div class="vestpocket" vest-pocket=""></div>
<blockquote> 
 <p>In regards to storage capacity, TrendForce’s supply chain sources claim that the iPhone 8 will have two options: 64GB and 256GB. What is notable about this rumor is that the starting storage option would be 64GB instead of 32GB. However, it seems unusual that Apple would only offer two storage options. Generally, Apple has been selling each of its phones in three storage tiers, including the iPhone 7 -- which has 32GB, 128GB and 256GB options.</p>

<p><strong>No More Fingerprints On The iPhone 8?</strong></p>
<p>Then there’s the question of identifying a user. The last few years has seen Apple use TouchID for fingerprint verification. With the presumed removal of the physical home key on the iPhone 8, the expectation has been that Tim Cook’s wonder-phone would read your fingerprint through the glass of the screen. JP Morgan’s Rod Hall suggests that Apple will drop TouchID in favour of facial recognition. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2017/02/19/iphone-8-touchid-facial-recognition-iris-scanner/" target="_self">Forbes’ contributor Gordon Kelly highlights the problems</a>:</p>
<blockquote> 
 <p>The flip side is that facial recognition requires a more deliberate unlocking procedure of holding the phone up to your face which can be inconvenient (especially when walking) and may make users more self-conscious than fingerprint unlocking. Facial recognition can also be less reliable for users who wear glasses, contact lenses or sunglasses though this is something the iris scanner in Samsung’s ill-fated Galaxy Note 7 aced.</p>

<p><strong>But The iPhone Will Be Boring Anyway</strong></p>
<p>For all the interest and excitement over the new iPhone, it’s worth remembering that any new technology introduced into Apple’s smartphone is likely to have been seen before in competitors’ handsets. It might be repackaged as new to the iPhone, but the advances in the iPhone 8 aren’t always surprises. Which I suspect is by design, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2017/02/23/apple-iphone-8-leak-rumor-new-technology/" target="_self">Apple can’t risk pushing too hard and having an iPhone fail</a>:</p>
<blockquote> 
 <p>The argument put forward is that Apple is rarely (if ever) first with new technology, but takes the time to perfect the technological advances and have them available in an accessible way. That’s a great press spin, but I feel the issue is more about minimizing risk rather than chasing critical acclaim.</p> 
 <p>Apple’s biggest issue is that with a very small portfolio of devices and a significant portion of company revenue coming from the sale of its smartphones it cannot afford to take risks in the way that other manufacturers can. Samsung’s Note 7 is a good example of the danger -- the South Korean company had a wide range of products to fall back on when the Note 7 recall saddled the company with a significant charge and no phablet revenue to cover it during Q4 2016. If a similar fate were to happen to an iPhone then Apple has very little depth on the bench to cover any loss of business.</p>
