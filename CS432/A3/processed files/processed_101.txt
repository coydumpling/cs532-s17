Predators' Forsberg posts third straight three-point effortFilip Forsberg refuses to settle for anything less than three-point performances.

The 22-year-old Nashville Predators pivot made waves earlier this week after posting consecutive hat tricks in games against the Calgary Flames and Colorado Avalanche, and continued his run during the club's 5-2 win over the Washington Capitals on Saturday night.

He might not have earned the hat trick of hat tricks, but Forsberg came pretty close, posting a goal and two assists for his third straight three-point game.

That the young forward achieved the feat against Washington was likely all the more satisfying for Forsberg, as he flexed his offensive muscle in front of the team that traded him away four years ago.

After starting 2016-17 at a disappointing pace, Forsberg has been crushing the opposition as of late to make up ground. With his trio of exceptional performances in tow, he now sits at 45 points on the year through 60 games, putting him on pace for his third straight 60-point season.
