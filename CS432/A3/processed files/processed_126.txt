The Shadow War on President TrumpIt is kind of hard to declare that those attending these town halls are not rehearsed when one person speaks and 50 more start chanting, in unison, the same catch phrase at the same time…as if on cue. It is clear that even, if not all, there is a good majority of organized activities to disrupt Republican activities that seem to be much like those which were employed by Obama associate Bob Cramer, the DNC and the Clinton campaign at Trump rallies prior to the election.



FreeBeacon’s Joe Schoffstall reports that a group serving as a central hub of information for congressional town halls was founded by a former Hillary Clinton campaign staffer and its parent company is located at the same address as an organization funded by liberal billionaire George Soros.

The Town Hall Project, a group that serves as a one-stop shop of information for town hall protests across the country, is connected to a former Clinton staffer and is also closely affiliated with a number of liberal groups.

The group, which has been referenced by media outlets on numerous occasions, bills itself as a “volunteer-powered, grassroots effort that empowers constituents across the country to have face-to-face conversations with their elected representatives.”

Jimmy Dahman, a former field organizer for the Clinton campaign in Iowa, founded the Town Hall Project. Dahman claimed on CNN that the town hall events are “all organic and happening at the grassroots level.”
