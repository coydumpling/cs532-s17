Bernard Amankwah, one of the sensational gospel music icons in Ghana, is gearing up to host this year’s edition of ‘Celebration of His Grace’ concert in Accra.

This year’s concert would be used to raise funds to assist some selected needy institutions in the country. The concert, according to the multi-talented songwriter, would witness a gathering of believers of the gospel from all walks of life, adding, “This is an event you will not want to miss.” Bernard Amankwah, who is credited with several hit songs including like ‘Presence’, ‘Presence II’, ‘Almighty’, ‘The Glory Has Come’, ‘Holy’, ‘Mercy Rescue Me’, among others, has made a tremendous impact in motivating and inspiring so many people both in and out of the church. His projects lined up for the future include writing and producing songs for budding music talents as well as hosting another concert in Kumasi, adding, “It is time for gospel music icons who expect great things from God to support the needy in society because God is ready to support all those who have the welfare of the needy at heart.” Bernard’s contribution to the music industry in Ghana would undoubtedly add to the rich repertoire of musical works that the country already has.
