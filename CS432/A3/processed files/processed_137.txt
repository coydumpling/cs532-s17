Trump Tower developer sues Vancouver company over shoddy constructionThe developer of Trump International Tower and Hotel is suing a local construction company, claiming that shoddy work and poor management of trade contractors delayed the high-profile project.

Holborn Developments (West Georgia) Ltd. filed a notice of civil claim on Jan. 17 in B.C. Supreme Court with a list of over 25 complaints about Richmond-based Urban One Construction Management.

These included failure to establish a project schedule and properly supervise trade contractors. The claim said Urban One allowed sub-par work to pass, did not inspect appliances to make sure they were in good condition and misled Holborn about possible schedule delays.

According to the claim, the two companies entered a construction management contract in July 2012.

None of the allegations have been proven in court.

In an email, Urban One Construction Management Inc. said it was “founded five years ago and is responsible for managing some of the highest-profile construction developments in Western Canada. Urban One stands behind the quality of our services, reputation and people. There is no substance or merit behind the allegations identified in the lawsuit filed by Holborn Developments (West Georgia) Ltd. and we intend to vigorously defend against these claims.”

The tower was supposed to open last summer, but, due to construction delays, residents only moved into the condo part of the tower recently.

The hotel part is slated to open soon, according to Holborn, which didn’t give a specific target date.

The City of Vancouver said Holborn has completed a final inspection and is working “to resolve any minor deficiency” in order to secure occupancy permits.

Holborn is asking for unspecified damages for breach of contract, negligence and construction delays. Holborn CEO Joo Kim Tiah did not reply to queries by deadline.
