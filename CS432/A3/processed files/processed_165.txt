Three men arrested after police drug raids at two Vauxhall nightclubsThree men have been arrested after police carried out drugs raids on two Vauxhall nightclubs.

Officers stormed both Fire and Lightbox, near Vauxhall station, during the early hours of last Friday morning in order to search party-goers and staff.

One 30-year-old member of staff was arrested at Lightbox on suspicion of possession of Class A drugs.

Another man, also 30, was arrested on suspicion of possession of Class A drugs and of breaching a court order.

A third man, 28, was arrested at the same venue on suspicion of handling stolen goods.

All three were taken into custody at a south London police station where they remain.

The operation followed tip-offs that drugs were being sold inside the venues. Police said there had also been complaints from nearby residents about a rise in anti-social behaviour outside the clubs.

Chief Inspector Lance Lamnea, of Lambeth borough, said: "This operation was based on intelligence that indicated harmful substances were being sold at these nightclubs. We are committed to supporting a vibrant night time economy in the capital, but where we suspect offences are taking place we must take swift action to protect the public.

"In this case, anti-social behaviour - believed to be generated by those attending the clubs - has been having a detrimental effect on the lives of those living and working in the area.

"We will be working closely with both the clubsâ€™ management and our partners to ensure the continuing safety of the public and consider whether there will be any impact on licensing issues."

The Standard has approached both Fire and Lightbox for comment.
