Friends! â€” The Plight of the Stuttering JournalistMy stutter is pretty severe and I do find myself having more, lengthier fluent moments when I speak with my best friend. But I still stutter, often and quite severely. I guess the biggest difference is that, with Patrice, I hardly think about my stutter or my speech at all.

Usually when I'm speaking, my stutter comes to mind -- whether voluntarily or involuntarily. I wonder which technique I could use to speak more effectively, I wonder which words I could substitute in place of the ones I'd really like to say (I know, I know. I'm working on that).
