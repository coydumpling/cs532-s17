Perez fires back at Trump: I'll be your worst nightmareTom Perez fired back at President Trump on Saturday after the president offered the newly elected Democratic National Committee (DNC) chairman a mock-congratulatory tweet.

"Call me Tom. And don't get too happy," tweeted Perez, the former Labor secretary during the Obama administration.

Perez added that Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), his primary rival for the DNC position that he appointed his deputy, would join other Democrats in being Trump's "worst nightmare."

Call me Tom. And don't get too happy. @keithellison and I, and Democrats united across the country, will be your worst nightmare. https://t.co/fu7WvLofrD — Tom Perez (@TomPerez) February 25, 2017

The response came after Trump tweeted that he "could not be happier" for Perez – or the Republican Party – following the former Labor secretary's election to lead the Democratic Party.

The Republican Party also knocked Perez in a statement referring to him as "a D.C. insider."

"By selecting a D.C. insider, Democrats only create deeper divisions within their own party by pushing a far left agenda that rejects a majority of their base outside Washington," RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said.

"The DNC would be well-served to learn from two straight election cycle losses, encourage leaders in their party to listen to what the voters want and to get to work with Republicans to fix the mess they created."

DNC members elected Perez on a second ballot during voting on Saturday in Atlanta. He won 235 votes, passing the 218 majority needed to win. Ellison took 200 votes on both ballots.
