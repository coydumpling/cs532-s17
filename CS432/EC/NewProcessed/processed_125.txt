Chiropractic News by ChiroNexus – http://www.drnotley.com/One of the problems I love treating are headaches. Cervicogenic headaches, headaches that are a result of problems with the neck joints or muscles, are often successfully treated with spinal manipulation (“cracking joints”), Active Release Techniques, acupuncture and exercise. Treating people for migraines, on the other hand, is a little trickier.

In the research, there seems to be little benefit of chiropractic manipulation during an acute migraine. There is evidence that it can help reduce the severity and frequency of subsequent migraines. Acupuncture has also been shown to help reduce pain during an acute migraine. Sadly, when a person has a full blown migraine they will likely not be wanting to leave the house and come to the office. Acute sufferers will want to stay still in a quiet, dark room. So how can a person help with their migraines if they do not use medications? I found this interesting research paper that may be a benefit for acute migraine suffers. Check it out
