I'm Going To Social Media Marketing WorldPublished on Feb 23, 2017

I'm going to Social Media Marketing World 2017 thanks to Carlos Gil. After being chosen by Carlos to join him in San Diego, I felt the best way to send a massive thank you would be here. If you don't know Carlos, please check him out below. If you do, but haven't caught up with his content in a while, check out the Hustle Diaries. His series is incredible!
