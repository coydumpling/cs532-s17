Uber In The News: Uber passengers and drivers can feel a bit safer, thanks to a partnership between the popular cab-hailing service and multiple security response services. “The new partnership involves an improvement to Uber’s current security number to all drivers,” the company announced. This follows the piloting of SOS buttons for Uber drivers in Johannesburg last year. Five hundred driver-partner vehicles were fitted with buttons that alerted Uber’s central control room. “We learned a great deal from the pilot last year, most importantly that the response time needed to be reduced,” said David Myers, head of trust and safety, Middle East and Africa, at Uber. Uber has now partnered with multiple private security firms because they are “geo-specific”.

“This means help will get to driver-partners far quicker than before. Security patrols cover a smaller area and response times are far quicker,” Uber said. Myers said: “In essence, we are connecting drivers with the closest security company in their area. Uber said calls to the control room would be recorded for possible use in investigations. “We are committed to making them feel as safe as possible when using our app. This improvement is a step in the right direction.”
