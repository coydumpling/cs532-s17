'There's not just one way of being beautiful'Since she was five, Lindsay Sanders noticed the subtle ways being black made her stand out.

Now 13 years old, Lindsay is facing colourism, also known as shade-ism - the discrimination based on the darkness of skin tone. Some of her friends have been driven to tears after getting picked on for their complexion.

"It's there, is real and it affects people." Lindsay says.

As an aspiring community leader, she wants people to rethink this preference and prejudice against women of colour,
