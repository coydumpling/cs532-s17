TORONTO — Transit service was delayed for hours in downtown Toronto on Thursday after a man allegedly followed GPS instructions that got him stuck in a streetcar tunnel.

Toronto Transit Commission spokesman Brad Ross says a streetcar came across the vehicle blocking the tunnel at one of the city’s main transit hubs shortly before 5:00 A.M. The car was in a tunnel on Queen’s Quay near Union station, the city’s busiest transit hub, where service was disrupted until just before noon on Thursday.

Ross says the man managed to drive nearly 800 metres into the tunnel before getting stuck. He also tweeted the man “claims he was following his GPS.”

He allegedly fled the scene for a time, but then returned and was issued a ticket by transit enforcement officers.

This will take some time to clear. Far more than it took the driver to get to this point, unfortunately. They fled, for the record. pic.twitter.com/hln4S4aSHw — Brad Ross (@bradTTC) February 23, 2017

Ross says a specialized crane was needed to remove the vehicle from the tunnel.

Service along two major downtown streetcar routes was delayed for nearly six hours while the TTC resolved the situation.
