Warn gym users about steroid risks, says watchdogSide effects of the drug, which are illegal to manufacture or supply but not to possess, can include mood disorders, heart disease and severe acne.

NICE experts want public health professionals to integrate themselves into gym-based and online fitness communities in order to push the message about the dangers of the drugs and growth hormones.

Many performance-enhancing substances are injectable and come with the risk of blood-borne disease like HIV, while unscrupulous online dealers often sell counterfeit drugs.

“We want to help prevent people at risk of drug misuse from taking drugs and we also want to prevent people who already use drugs from using them regularly and to excess,” said Professor Gillian leng, deputy chief executive at NICE.

The new guidance also recommends providing danger awareness materials at nightclubs and music festivals.

Jim McVeigh, an expert in public health and one of the academics consulted by NICE, said the most commonly abused drugs were those to enhance muscularity.

“The modern image has changed,” he said.

“People are a lot more body-conscious than they were a generation ago and society as whole is a lot more aware of appearance.”

This, combined with the new “selfie” culture and the ease of acquiring steroids and growth hormones online, was pushing the rise in use, he said.

Other drugs targeted by the new NICE guidance include slimming substances, as well as skin lightening and darkening drugs.

Professor David Croisdale-Appleby, chair of the guideline committee, said: “Raising awareness about drug use and giving clear information about their potentially devastating effects, along with practical advice, will help contribute to the wider issues of preventing drug misuse.”
