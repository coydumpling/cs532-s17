Hillary's Shame: Chelsea's Felon Father-In-Law Owes IRS $200K!The release of Hillary Clinton‘s own tax records held few surprises for politicos, but RadarOnline.com has learned her extended family is hiding a shameful tax secret: Chelsea‘s father-in-law, Ed Mezvinsky, has owed the IRS more than $200,000 for more than ten years!

According to tax records obtained by Radar, Mezvinsky was slapped with a federal tax lien totaling $201,934 on January 30, 2006.

As of press time,records indicate he had not yet paid the bill.

That’s hardly the first of Mezvinsky’s financial scandals, however.

In 2002, Mezvinsky pleaded guilty to 31 counts of fraud after he orchestrated a $10 million Ponzi scheme to scam money from friends and family. He served five years in federal prison and was released in 2008.

Meanwhile, his son and Chelsea’s husband, Marc, is embroiled in a scandal of his own after the sudden shuttering of his hedge fund, Eaglevale.

The fund invested in Greek bank stocks and bought government debt, hoping the country’s economy would bounce back and deliver profits. But that never happened, and almost 90% of the $25 million they raised from investors has been lost.

A rep for the Clintons did not respond to Radar’s request for comment.
