Transport officials said on Friday that the proposal to adopt the mainland's right-hand drive traffic arrangement on the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge is unchallengeable.



The Under Secretary for Transport Yau Shing-mu told a meeting of the Legislative Council's Panel on Transport that the arrangement was to ensure road safety, and to reduce the need for vehicles to change lanes while travelling at high speeds.



He said it was the best arrangement they could come up with.



Yau said the main bridge was located in mainland territory, and was therefore managed by the mainland authorities. He added the main traffic flow will be from Hong Kong to the mainland.
