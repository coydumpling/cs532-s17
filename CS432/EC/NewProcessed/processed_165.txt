MAC Cosmetics Basic Bitch Eye Shadow PaletteBackstage at Fashion Week is a magical — albeit frenzied — place. Not only do you get to see stylists and makeup artists showcase their talents on some of the most beautiful women in the world, but you get a sneak peek at new products that won't hit shelves for months. The pros of MAC Cosmetics have been flaunting upcoming launches from New York to Milan (remember that pizza cutter eyeliner?) but a preview of a palette has us especially excited.

Behind the scenes during Milan Fashion Week, MAC senior artist Netta Szekely and national artist Angelo Rauseo took to their Instagram accounts to tease the pettily-titled "Basic B*tch" palette, which is said to feature all new shades and textures. The long, rectangular compact holds nine pans (one of which is extra large and could possibly be a highlighter) of pigment with hilarious names, including Gameplayer, Hell in Heels, Me Me Me, and Text Me Later. The cool-toned shades range from a sparkling pewter to burgundy.

We have reached out to MAC Cosmetics for more information on this palette, but based on the delectable colors inside, we'd guess that it will launch in time for Fall. Stay tuned for updates as they become available.
